            My role is to invent and build data products, including applications for business users and
            data tools for internal research. I am the primary programmer but have also hired two developers 
            and am responsible for making decisions about our technology stack and best practices.

            I taught NYU-SCPS's first data journalism class to a small group of students without strong
            technical backgrounds. We focused on storytelling and reporting techniques specific to data, and
            thorough hands-on experience with data tools. I also [built a website to easily](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com) share data, tutorials, and readings.

            - title: Ruby
              desc: |
                  The Ruby language is my workhorse scripting language, for both full-fledged applications and impromptu 
                  utility scripts. I often use Ruby as a glue between scripts from more specialized languages, such as R and SQL.
            - title: Ruby on Rails
              desc: | 
                  This is my primary web framework, which I've used to build award-winning in-depth news projects that can handle
                  traffic from millions of users. I've also built apps using the more minimalist Sinatra and Padrino frameworks.
            - title: Databases
              desc: | 
                  My main production database languages are MySQL and SQLite, which I use as data stores for both web applications 
                  and large data-mining operations and analyses. I've also used MongoDB for web applications.
            - title: JavaScript
              desc: |
                  Most of my JS work is in user-interface features and visualizations with libraries such as jQuery, D3, and Highcharts. I also
                  have some experience with client-heavy frameworks such as AngularJS.
            - title: Code and project management
              desc: | 
                  I use git daily for tracking personal and for managing professional team projects and I 
                  regularly contribute to Github open-source repositories. I have extensive experience in 
                  test-driven development, particularly with the RSpec and Jasmine libraries.
            - title: System Operations
              desc: | 
                  I've deployed, secured, and maintained web sites both on hosted platforms and custom cloud servers, including Heroku
                  and Amazon EC2. 
            - title: PHP
              desc: | 
                  This was my first language for building interactive news projects, including a crime mapper, and I currently use it to maintain WordPress sites.

                  I almost always build the front-ends to my web projects, often using 
                  popular frameworks such as Bootstrap and Zerb. I also use alternative markup languages, such as Haml, Slim, and Markdown.
            - title: CSS
              desc: | 
                  In addition to using the latest CSS standards and building responsive layouts (when needed), I use extension frameworks 
                  such as Sass/Compass and LESS for production work.
            - title: Photography
              desc: | 
                  I do photography as a hobby and for occasional side jobs, including news stories, sports events, weddings, and NY Fashion Week events. Have also published online how-to guides.
            - title: Photo Editing
              desc: | 
                  I have more than a decade's worth of experience in using photo editing and processing software, particularly Adobe's
                  Photoshop and Lightroom.

                  for the Online News Association.
                  I wrote the Bastards Book of Ruby, an online reference that has been visited by more than 300,000 readers.
            - title: Data Journalism
              desc: | 
                  At New York University, I taught a course on basic data journalism concepts and practical techniques and built a class website 
                  to share the materials and lessons.
            - title: Data and Tech Skills
              desc: |
                  I've taught data tool workshops to general journalism audiences, including
                  at National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting conferences and the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, Italy.
            - title: Photography
