			h2 style="margin-top:0" About Dan
			p I am a data journalist, programmer, and photographer. I'm currently Head of Data at #{link_to "Skift", "//skift.com"}, where I lead both application development and 
				data research. Previously, I was a #{link_to "news application developer at ProPublica", "http://www.propublica.org/site/author/dan_nguyen"} and a reporter at the #{link_to "Sacramento Bee", "//sacbee.com"}. 
				I've taught numerous workshops on programming and data, including 
				#{link_to "Data Journalism at NYU-SCPS", "//smalldatajournalism.com"}, and have
				self-published a series of 
			  #{link_to "popular", "http://photography.bastardsbook.com/"}  
				#{link_to "online books", "http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/"}.
			

			h4 Technical notes
			p I built this portfolio site using the #{link_to "Middleman framework", "//middlemanapp.com"}, a static site generator in Ruby. 
				So it's just plain HTML, CSS, and JS files #{link_to "hosted on Amazon's S3 service", "http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/using-amazon-s3/"}, 
				which makes it easy to maintain and fast to load.

		p I've kept my own blog for about 5 years now. My proudest achievement is, for a time, beating the more famous and #{{link_to "musically-talented Dan Nguyen in Google search", "https://www.google.com/search?q=dan+nguyen"}}  results.

		p I'm lucky to live in New York, in which #{{link_to "events such as snow falling", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/zokuga/4204160273"}} become immediately interesting just because they happened in New York.

	div class="col-sm-4"

			a href="//tumblr.eyeheartnewyork.com/" Eye Heart New York
		p This is my attempt at understanding how Tumblr works. It has a decent following from me funneling my Flickr photos into it, but I still don't quite understand Tumblr.	

	div class="col-sm-4"
		h4 class="title" 
			a href="//twitter.com/dancow" @dancow
		p I have a large international following of people mistaking me for #{{link_to "a popular Nestle drink in Indonesia", "http://www.dancow.co.id/"}}.

			a href="//github.com/dannguyen" Github
		p Most of my repos are private and involve company work. I use github mostly to store half-finished utilities that work for my own purposes but probably aren't convenient for others to use.
